General Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To compile this you need a couple things
  - A working POSIX system with working POSIX gcc, g++, make (GNU),
    ar, sh, awk and sed in the path
  - GNU Make 3.74 or so, -- normal UNIX make will NOT work
    * Note 3.77 is broken.    
  - A working ANSI C++ compiler, this is not g++ 2.7.* 
    g++ 2.8 works OK and newer egcs work well also. Nobody has tried it
    on other compilers :< You will need a properly working STL as well.
  - A C library with the usual POSIX functions and a BSD socket layer. 
    If you OS conforms to the Single User Spec then you are fine:

Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~
I am not interested in making 'ultra portable code'. I will accept patches
to make the code that already exists conform more to SUS or POSIX, but
I don't really care if your not-SUS OS doesn't work. It is simply too
much work to maintain patches for dysfunctional OSs. I highly suggest you
contact your vendor and express intrest in a conforming C library.

That said, there are lots of finniky problems that must be delt with even
between the supported OS's. Primarily the path I choose to take is to put
a shim header file in build/include that transparently adds the required 
functionality. Patches to make autoconf detect these cases and generate the 
required shims are OK.

Current shims:
  * C9x integer types 'inttypes.h' 
  * sys/statvfs.h to convert from BSD statfs to SUS statvfs  
  * rfc2553 hostname resolution (methods/rfc*), shims to normal gethostbyname.
  
The only completely non-shimed OS is Linux with glibc2.1

Platform Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Debian GNU Linux 2.1 'slink'
Debian GNU Linux 'potato'
  * All Archs
  - Works flawlessly
  - You will want to have debiandoc-sgml and yodl installed to get
    best results.
  - No IPv6 Support in glibc's < 2.1

Sun Solaris
  SunOS cab101 5.7 Generic_106541-04 sun4u sparc
  - Works fine
  - Note, no IPv6 Support, OS lacks RFC 2553 hostname resolution
   
HP-UX
  HP-UX nyquist B.10.20 C 9000/780 2016574337 32-user license
  - Evil OS, does not conform very well to SUS
     1) snprintf exists but is not prototyped, ignore spurios warnings
     2) No socklen_t
     3) Requires -D_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED for h_errno
    Items 2 and 3 have to be fixed by hand. Insert this into
    build/include/netdb.h:
    
    #define _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED
    #define socklen_t size_t
    #include_next <netdb.h>
    
    A similar techinque can be used for snprintf/vsprintf if you dislike 
    the warnings
  - Note, no IPv6 Support, OS lacks RFC 2553 hostname resolution
