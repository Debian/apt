# This file is input for triehash(1) (after stripping comments)

# The fields listed here are accessible via pkgTagSection::Key::FIELD
# Do *NOT* edit, remove or insert new fields in the sorted section here
# as the file forms part of the ABI of the libapt library and is used
# by our apt tools. External clients are forbidden though, so if really needed
# we can use libapt Breaks: apt, but always prefer appending only.

# For Fields used in Packages, Sources and status files, see also tagfile-order.c
