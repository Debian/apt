   \brief pkgCache - Structure definitions for the cache file

   The goal of the cache file is two fold:
   Firstly to speed loading and processing of the package file array and
   secondly to reduce memory consumption of the package file array.

   The implementation is aimed at an environment with many primary package
   files, for instance someone that has a Package file for their CD-ROM, a
   Package file for the latest version of the distribution on the CD-ROM and a
   package file for the development version. Always present is the information
   contained in the status file which might be considered a separate package
   file.

   Please understand, this is designed as a <b>Cache file</b> it is not meant to be
   used on any system other than the one it was created for. It is not meant to
   be authoritative either, i.e. if a system crash or software failure occurs it
   must be perfectly acceptable for the cache file to be in an inconsistent
   state. Furthermore at any time the cache file may be erased without losing
   any information.

   Also the structures and storage layout is optimized for use by the APT
   and may not be suitable for all purposes. However it should be possible
   to extend it with associate cache files that contain other information.

   To keep memory use down the cache file only contains often used fields and
   fields that are inexpensive to store, the Package file has a full list of
   fields. Also the client may assume that all items are perfectly valid and
   need not perform checks against their correctness. Removal of information
   from the cache is possible, but blanks will be left in the file, and
   unused strings will also be present. The recommended implementation is to
   simply rebuild the cache each time any of the data files change. It is
   possible to add a new package file to the cache without any negative side
   effects.

   <b>Note on Pointer access</b>
   Clients should always use the CacheIterators classes for access to the
   cache and the data in it. They also provide a simple STL-like method for
   traversing the links of the datastructure.

   Every item in every structure is stored as the index to that structure.
   What this means is that once the files is mmaped every data access has to
   go through a fix up stage to get a real memory pointer. This is done
   by taking the index, multiplying it by the type size and then adding
   it to the start address of the memory block. This sounds complex, but
   in C it is a single array dereference. Because all items are aligned to
   their size and indexes are stored as multiples of the size of the structure
   the format is immediately portable to all possible architectures - BUT the
   generated files are -NOT-.

   This scheme allows code like this to be written:
   <example>
     void *Map = mmap(...);
     Package *PkgList = (Package *)Map;
     Header *Head = (Header *)Map;
     char *Strings = (char *)Map;
     cout << (Strings + PkgList[Head->HashTable[0]]->Name) << endl;
   </example>
   Notice the lack of casting or multiplication. The net result is to return
   the name of the first package in the first hash bucket, without error
   checks.

   The generator uses allocation pools to group similarly sized structures in
   large blocks to eliminate any alignment overhead. The generator also
   assures that no structures overlap and all indexes are unique. Although
   at first glance it may seem like there is the potential for two structures
   to exist at the same point the generator never allows this to happen.
   (See the discussion of free space pools)

   See \ref pkgcachegen.h for more information about generating cache structures. */
