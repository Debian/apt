/** \brief generates and run the command to verify a file with gpgv
 *
 * If File and FileSig specify the same file it is assumed that we
 * deal with a clear-signed message. Note that the method will accept
 * and validate files which include additional (unsigned) messages
 * without complaining. Do NOT open files accepted by this method
 * for reading. Use #OpenMaybeClearSignedFile to access the message
 * instead to ensure you are only reading signed data.
 *
 * The method does not return, but has some notable exit-codes:
 * 111 signals an internal error like the inability to execute gpgv,
 * 112 indicates a clear-signed file which doesn't include a message,
 *  which can happen if APT is run while on a network requiring
 *  authentication before usage (e.g. in hotels)
 * All other exit-codes are passed-through from gpgv.
 *
 * @param File is the message (unsigned or clear-signed)
 * @param FileSig is the signature (detached or clear-signed)
 * @param statusfd is the fd given to gpgv as --status-fd
 * @param fd is used as a pipe for the standard output of gpgv
 * @param key is the specific one to be used instead of using all

 *  which would have been written to it is silently discarded.
