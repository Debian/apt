   Acquire Item - Item to acquire

   When an item is instantiated it will add it self to the local list in
   the Owner Acquire class. Derived classes will then call QueueURI to
   register all the URI's they wish to fetch at the initial moment.

   Three item classes are provided to provide functionality for
   downloading of Index, Translation and Packages files.

   A Archive class is provided for downloading .deb files. It does Hash
   checking and source location as well as a retry algorithm.
