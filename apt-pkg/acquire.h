   Acquire - File Acquiration
   
   This module contains the Acquire system. It is responsible for bringing
   files into the local pathname space. It deals with URIs for files and
   URI handlers responsible for downloading or finding the URIs.
   
   Each file to download is represented by an Acquire::Item class subclassed
   into a specialization. The Item class can add itself to several URI
   acquire queues each prioritized by the download scheduler. When the 
   system is run the proper URI handlers are spawned and the the acquire 
   queues are fed into the handlers by the schedular until the queues are
   empty. This allows for an Item to be downloaded from an alternate source
   if the first try turns out to fail. It also alows concurrent downloading
   of multiple items from multiple sources as well as dynamic balancing
   of load between the sources.
   
   Schedualing of downloads is done on a first ask first get basis. This
   preserves the order of the download as much as possible. And means the
   fastest source will tend to process the largest number of files.
   
   Internal methods and queues for performing gzip decompression,
   md5sum hashing and file copying are provided to allow items to apply
   a number of transformations to the data files they are working with.

/** \defgroup acquire Acquire system					{{{
 *
 *  \brief The Acquire system is responsible for retrieving files from
 *  local or remote URIs and postprocessing them (for instance,
 *  verifying their authenticity).  The core class in this system is
 *  pkgAcquire, which is responsible for managing the download queues
 *  during the download.  There is at least one download queue for
 *  each supported protocol; protocols such as http may provide one
 *  queue per host.
 *
 *  Each file to download is represented by a subclass of
 *  pkgAcquire::Item.  The files add themselves to the download
 *  queue(s) by providing their URI information to
 *  pkgAcquire::Item::QueueURI, which calls pkgAcquire::Enqueue.
 *
 *  Once the system is set up, the Run method will spawn subprocesses
 *  to handle the enqueued URIs; the scheduler will then take items
 *  from the queues and feed them into the handlers until the queues
 *  are empty.
 *
 *  \todo Acquire supports inserting an object into several queues at
 *  once, but it is not clear what its behavior in this case is, and
 *  no subclass of pkgAcquire::Item seems to actually use this
 *  capability.
