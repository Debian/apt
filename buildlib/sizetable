# This file lists common architectures for cross-compilation (CPUs, not
# OSs), and the endian-ness and relative type sizes. It is not needed for
# native compilation.
#
# If you wish to cross-compile APT, and your architecture is not listed
# here, you should add it, and submit it by email to the APT team at
# <apt@packages.debian.org>.
#
# This is used primarily for the MD5 algorithm.
# The format is:-
# CPU endian sizeof: char, int, short, long
