Apt is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL),
version 2.0 or later, as published by the Free Software Foundation.  See
the file COPYING.GPL [included], /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL, or
<http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.txt> for the terms of the latest version
of the GNU General Public License.

In addition, prior to November 15th, 2000, apt may be distributed under
terms identical to the above with the following addition:

Works using apt may link against the GUI library "libqt", copyright by
Troll Tech AS, Norway, provided that:

1. The version of "libqt" is licensed under the terms of the "Qt Free Edition
   License" published by Troll Tech AS.  The license terms identified as
   the Qt Free Edition License below are the only such terms under which
   distribution of works derived from both apt and "libqt" are permitted;

and

2. The source code of the version of "libqt" used is

   a) Distributed with the binary version;

   or

   b) Downloadable by anyone, without fee, using a publicly-announced
      URL on the Internet, for a duration of at least three years
      starting with distribution of the binary version.

On and after November 15th, 2000, the above additional terms lose all
force, and apt will be licensed only under the terms of the GNU General
Public License, version 2.0 or later.

      _______________________________________________________________

The following text, up to the text of the Qt Free Edition License, is
informational and not part of the license terms on apt.

Modifications to apt in either source or compiled form must be licensed
under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2.0 (or later),
but need not include the above clause permitting usage of the "libqt"
library under the Qt Free Edition License.  Note that removal of this
clause will result in software which is not licensed for binary
redistribution linked against software governed by the Qt Free Edition
License.  In the event that a version of "libqt" is released that is
licensed under terms that do not conflict with the GPL, the additional
clause above is not required to grant permission for distribution of works
that are derived from both apt and "libqt".

No part of apt is licensed under the Qt Free Edition License.  The terms
below are provided to help identify the circumstances under which the
"libqt" library may be used with apt (or a work derived from both).  The
terms below are copied from the LICENSE file of the qt-1.44 distribution,
as of November 10th, 1999.
