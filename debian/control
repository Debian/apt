Description: commandline package manager
 This package provides commandline tools for searching and
 managing as well as querying information about packages
 as a low-level access to all features of the libapt-pkg library.
 .
 These include:
  * apt-get for retrieval of packages and information about them
    from authenticated sources and for installation, upgrade and
    removal of packages together with their dependencies
  * apt-cache for querying available information about installed
    as well as installable packages
  * apt-cdrom to use removable media as a source for packages
  * apt-config as an interface to the configuration settings
  * apt-key as an interface to manage authentication keys

Description: package management runtime library
 This library provides the common functionality for searching and
 managing packages as well as information about packages.
 Higher-level package managers can depend upon this library.
 .
 This includes:
  * retrieval of information about packages from multiple sources
  * retrieval of packages and all dependent packages
    needed to satisfy a request either through an internal
    solver or by interfacing with an external one
  * authenticating the sources and validating the retrieved data
  * installation and removal of packages in the system
  * providing different transports to retrieve data over cdrom, ftp,
    http, rsh as well as an interface to add more transports like
    https (apt-transport-https) and debtorrent (apt-transport-debtorrent).

Description: package management related utility programs
 This package contains some less used commandline utilities related
 to package management with APT.
 .
  * apt-extracttemplates is used by debconf to prompt for configuration
    questions before installation.
  * apt-ftparchive is used to create Packages and other index files
    needed to publish an archive of Debian packages
  * apt-sortpkgs is a Packages/Sources file normalizer.

Package: apt-transport-https
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: ca-certificates
Priority: optional
Description: https download transport for APT
 This package enables the usage of 'deb https://foo distro main' lines
 in the /etc/apt/sources.list so that all package managers using the
 libapt-pkg library can access metadata and packages available in sources
 accessible over https (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure).
 .
 This transport supports server as well as client authentication
 with certificates.
