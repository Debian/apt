Title: APT Cache Specification
Author: Jason Gunthorpe
Abstract: The APT Cache Specification describes the complete implementation
 and format of the APT Cache file. The APT Cache file is a way for APT to
 parse and store a large number of package files for display in the UI.
 It's primary design goal is to make display of a single package in the
 tree very fast by pre-linking important things like dependencies and
 provides. The specification doubles as documentation for one of the
 in-memory structures used by the package library and the APT GUI.
