apt (3.1.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  The new solver is now the default.

  The new --cli-version optionr equests a specific CLI version.

  The default --cli-version is the current APT version for the apt(8) command
  or 0.(10 * major + minor) for the other command.

  If --cli-version is specified, the output of the apt(8) command may be
  recorded. This allows for replacing legacy commands like apt-get(8) in
  scripts.

  The legacy commands may roll-over to the 2.X series in the future.
  For further information on this mechanism, consult the apt(8) manual
  page.

apt (2.9.24) unstable; urgency=medium

  /etc/apt/trusted.gpg is no longer trusted. Setting the Dir::Etc::trusted
  option manually continues to work for some more time.

  sources.list(5) entries without the Signed-By field are deprecated;
  migrate any legacy entries to the deb822 .sources format. See the
  apt-secure(8) manual page for best practices for signer configuration.
  This deprecates the /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d directory.

apt (2.9.19) unstable; urgency=medium

  This release switches to OpenSSL for hashing and TLS, replacing the
  GnuTLS and gcrypt libraries.

  This release switches to Sequoia for OpenPGP verification on supported
  Debian platforms. A Sequoia policy override enabling SHA1 self-signatures
  until 2026 is included. To override the policy, the following environment
  variables and files are considered:

  * The APT_SEQUOIA_CRYPTO_POLICY environment variable, and failing that:
    - /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/apt-sequoia.config,
    - /var/lib/crypto-config/profiles/current/apt-sequoia.config
  * The SEQUOIA_CRYPTO_POLICY environment variable, and failing that:
    - /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/sequoia.config
    - /var/lib/crypto-config/profiles/current/sequoia.config

apt (2.9.15) unstable; urgency=medium

  This release stops using apt-key to verify the signatures.
  Final call to stop using it before it's gone next week.

  Please note that due to the switch to internal verification, APT now
  has the same requirements on files in trusted.gpg.d as for other .d
  directories: Only alphanumerical characters, '_', '-', ':' and '.'
  are supported, other characters such as '@' cause the file to silently
  be ignored.

apt (2.9.11) unstable; urgency=medium

  The ftp, rsh, and ssh methods have been removed. They have been unsupported
  and disabled since 1.8. Please, migrate to http(s) instead, or contribute
  an sftp method.

  If you need ad hoc access to a remote repository, you can usually run
  `python3 -m http.server` on that machine and use SSH port forwarding to
  run HTTP over SSH.

 -- Julian Andres Klode <jak@debian.org>  Thu, 07 Nov 2024 14:02:07 +0100

apt (2.5.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Installing or upgrading a binary package now upgrades other binaries from
  the same source package if they have the same candidate version. You can
  disable this by setting `APT::Get::Upgrade-By-Source-Package` to `false`.

 -- Julian Andres Klode <juliank@ubuntu.com>  Sun, 24 Jul 2022 15:45:15 +0200

apt (2.4.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  GPG verification now first tries only the trusted.gpg.d keys, before
  then falling back to the legacy trusted.gpg keyring and issuing a
  warning to migrate keys if verification succeeded in the fallback.

 -- Julian Andres Klode <jak@debian.org>  Tue, 22 Feb 2022 20:01:00 +0100

apt (2.3.12) unstable; urgency=medium

  The solver will no longer try to remove Essential or Protected packages,
  any dependency problem that would need such a solution will have to be
  resolved manually.

  The "Yes, do as I say" prompt for removing essential packages has been
  replaced by an error message. The appropriate command-line option needs
  to be used instead.

  Thank you to Linus Tech Tips and System76 for bringing this issue
  to our attention.

apt (2.1.16) unstable; urgency=medium

  Automatically remove unused kernels on apt {dist,full}-upgrade. To revert
  to previous behavior, set APT::Get::AutomaticRemove::Kernels to false or
  pass --no-auto-remove to the command. apt-get remains unchanged.

  Packages files can now set the Phased-Update-Percentage field to restrict
  update rollout to a specified percentage of machines. Previously, this has
  only been available to users of Ubuntu's update-manager tool. See
  apt_preferences(5) for details and how to configure multiple systems to get
  the same updates. Phased updates are disabled in chroots for now to not
  break buildd-style setups.

apt (1.9.11) experimental; urgency=medium

  apt(8) now waits for the lock indefinitely if connected to a tty, or
  for 120 seconds if not.

 -- Julian Andres Klode <jak@debian.org>  Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:30:33 +0100

apt (1.9.6) experimental; urgency=medium

  apt(8) no longer treats package names passed as regular expressions or fnmatch
  expressions, requiring the use of patterns (apt-patterns(7)) to perform complex
  searches. For ease of use, regular expressions starting with ^ or ending with
  $ continue to work.

  This fixes the problem where e.g. g++ could mean either "the package g++"
  or, if there is no g++ package, "all packages containing g". This change
  will propagate to apt-* after the release of Debian bullseye.

 -- Julian Andres Klode <jak@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Jan 2020 21:45:18 +0100

apt (1.9.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  Credentials in apt_auth.conf(5) now only apply to https and tor+https
  sources to avoid them being leaked over plaintext (Closes: #945911). To
  opt-in to http, add http:// before the hostname. Note that this will transmit
  credentials in plain text, which you do not want on devices that could be
  operating in an untrusted network.

 -- Julian Andres Klode <juliank@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 02 Dec 2019 11:45:52 +0100

apt (1.8.0~alpha3) unstable; urgency=medium

  The PATH for running dpkg is now configured by the option DPkg::Path,
  and defaults to "/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin". Previous behavior of
  not changing PATH may be restored by setting the option to an empty string.

  Support for /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/ has been added, see apt_auth.conf(5).

 -- Julian Andres Klode <jak@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Dec 2018 15:02:11 +0100

apt (1.6~rc1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Seccomp sandboxing has been turned off by default for now. If it works
  for you, you are encouraged to re-enable it by setting APT::Sandbox::Seccomp
  to true.

 -- Julian Andres Klode <jak@debian.org>  Fri, 06 Apr 2018 14:14:29 +0200

apt (1.6~beta1) unstable; urgency=medium

  APT now verifies that the date of Release files is not in the future. By
  default, it may be 10 seconds in the future to allow for some clock drift.

  Two new configuration options can be used to tweak the behavior:
    Acquire::Check-Date
    Acquire::Max-DateFuture

  These can be overridden in sources.list entries using the check-date
  and date-future-max options. Note that disabling check-date also
  disables checks on valid-until: It is considered to mean that your
  machine's time is not reliable.

 -- Julian Andres Klode <jak@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Feb 2018 13:14:13 +0100

apt (1.6~alpha1) unstable; urgency=medium

  All methods provided by apt except for cdrom, gpgv, and rsh now
  use seccomp-BPF sandboxing to restrict the list of allowed system
  calls, and trap all others with a SIGSYS signal. Three options
  can be used to configure this further:

    APT::Sandbox::Seccomp is a boolean to turn it on/off
    APT::Sandbox::Seccomp::Trap is a list of names of more syscalls to trap
    APT::Sandbox::Seccomp::Allow is a list of names of more syscalls to allow

  Also, sandboxing is now enabled for the mirror method.

apt (1.5~beta1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ New HTTPS method ]
  The default http method now supports HTTPS itself, including encrypted proxies
  and connecting to HTTPS sites via HTTPS proxies; and the apt-transport-https
  package only provides a "curl+https" method now as a fallback, but will be
  removed shortly. If TLS support is unwanted, it can be disabled overall by
  setting the option Acquire::AllowTLS to "false".

  As for backwards compatibility, the options IssuerCert and SslForceVersion
  are not supported anymore, and any specified certificate files must be in the
  PEM format (curl might have allowed DER files as well).

  [ Changes to unauthenticated repositories ]
  The security exception for apt-get to only raise warnings if it encounters
  unauthenticated repositories in the "update" command is gone now, so that it
  will raise errors just like apt and all other apt-based front-ends do since
  at least apt version 1.3.

  It is possible (but STRONGLY ADVISED AGAINST) to revert to the previous
  behaviour of apt-get by setting the option
    Binary::apt-get::Acquire::AllowInsecureRepositories "true";
  See apt-secure(8) manpage for configuration details.

  [ Release Info Changes ]
  If values like Origin, Label, and Codename change in a Release file,
  update fails, or asks a user (if interactive). Various
  --allow-releaseinfo-change are provided for non-interactive use.

 -- Julian Andres Klode <jak@debian.org>  Mon, 03 Jul 2017 15:09:23 +0200

apt (1.4.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  If periodic updates and unattended upgrades are enabled, the start of
  periodic updates are now distributed over 24 hour intervals (as in 1.2
  to 1.4), whereas starting unattended-upgrade has been restricted to a
  time between 6 and 7 am. This only affects systems using systemd, other
  systems still use the classical hourly cron job.

 -- Julian Andres Klode <jak@debian.org>  Thu, 04 May 2017 22:54:02 +0200

apt (1.4~beta1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Support for GPG signatures using the SHA1 or RIPE-MD/160 hash
  algorithms has been disabled. Repositories using Release files
  signed in such a way will stop working. This change has been made
  due to security considerations, especially with regards to possible
  further breakthroughs in SHA1 breaking during the lifetime
  of this APT release series.

  It is possible (but STRONGLY ADVISED AGAINST) to revert to the previous
  behaviour by setting the options
    APT::Hashes::SHA1::Weak "yes";
    APT::Hashes::RIPE-MD/160::Weak "yes";
  Note that setting these options only affects the verification of the overall
  repository signature.

apt (1.2~exp1) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Automatic removal of debs after install ]
  After packages are successfully installed by apt(8),
  the corresponding .deb package files will be
  removed from the /var/cache/apt/archives cache directory.

  This can be changed by setting the apt configuration option
    "Binary::apt::APT::Keep-Downloaded-Packages" to "true". E.g:

  # echo 'Binary::apt::APT::Keep-Downloaded-Packages "true";' \
      > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01keep-debs

  Please note that the behavior of apt-get is unchanged. The
  downloaded debs will be kept in the cache directory after they
  are installed. To enable the behavior for other tools, you can set
  "APT::Keep-Downloaded-Packages" to false.

  [ Compressed indices ]
  If you use Acquire::gzipIndexes, or any other compressed index targets,
  those will now be compressed with the fastest supported algorithm,
  currently lz4.

apt (1.1~exp9) experimental; urgency=medium

  A new algorithm for pinning has been implemented, it now assigns a
  pin priority to a version instead of assigning a pin to a package.

  This might break existing corner cases of pinning, if they use multiple
  pins involving the same package name or patterns matching the same
  package name, but should overall lead to pinning that actually works
  as intended and documented.

apt (0.8.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-get install pkg/experimental will now not only switch the
    candidate of package pkg to the version from the release experimental
    but also of all dependencies of pkg if the current candidate can't
    satisfy a versioned dependency.

apt (0.7.26~exp3) experimental; urgency=low

  * apt-ftparchive now reads the standard configuration files in
    /etc/apt/apt.conf and /etc/apt/apt.conf.d.

 -- Julian Andres Klode <jak@debian.org>  Fri, 26 Mar 2010 15:34:16 +0100

apt (0.7.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Already included in the last version but now with better documentation
    is the possibility to add/prefer different compression types while
    downloading archive information, which can decrease the time needed for
    update on slow machines. See apt.conf (5) manpage for details.
  * APT manages his manpage translations now with po4a, thanks to Nicolas
    François and Kurasawa Nozomu, who also provide the ja translation.
    Thanks to Christian Perrier we have already a fr translation and
    a few more are hopefully added in the near future.
  * This version also introduces some _experimental_ configuration options
    to make more aggressive use of dpkg's triggers. If you want to help
    testing these _experimental_ options see apt.conf (5) manpage.

apt (0.7.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Code that determines which proxy to use was changed. Now
    'Acquire::{http,ftp}::Proxy[::<host>]' options have the highest priority,
    and '{http,ftp}_proxy' environment variables are used only if options
    mentioned above are not specified.

apt (0.6.44) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-ftparchive --db now uses Berkeley DB_BTREE instead of DB_HASH. 
    If you use a database created by an older version of apt, delete 
    it and allow it to be recreated the next time.

 -- Michael Vogt <mvo@debian.org>  Wed, 26 Apr 2006 12:57:53 +0200

apt (0.5.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-ftparchive --db now uses Berkeley DB version 4.2.  If used with a
    database created by an older version of apt, an attempt will be made
    to upgrade the database, but this may not work in all cases.  If your
    database is not automatically upgraded, delete it and allow it to be
    recreated the next time.
