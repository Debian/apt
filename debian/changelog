  * Use "Codename" (woody, sarge, etc.) to supply the value of the
    "Archive" package file attribute, used to match "release a=" type
    pins, rather than "Suite" (stable, testing, etc.)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jan 2004 16:56:47 -0800

apt (0.6.9) experimental; urgency=low

  * Another tagfile workaround

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jan 2004 13:56:08 -0800

apt (0.6.8) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add a config option and corresponding command line option
    (--allow-unauthenticated) to apt-get, to make buildd operators happy
    (Closes: #225648)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 31 Dec 2003 08:28:04 -0800

apt (0.6.7) experimental; urgency=low

  * Forgot to revert part of the changes to tagfile in 0.6.4.  Hopefully
    will fix segfaults for some folks.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 31 Dec 2003 08:01:28 -0800

apt (0.6.6) experimental; urgency=low

  * Restore the ugly hack I removed from indexRecords::Load which set the
    pkgTagFile buffer size to (file size)+256.  This is concealing a bug,
    but I can't fix it right now.  This should fix the segfaults that
    folks are seeing with 0.6.[45].

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Dec 2003 18:11:13 -0800

apt (0.6.5) experimental; urgency=low

  * Move the authentication check into a separate function in apt-get
  * Fix display of unauthenticated packages when they are in the cache
    (Closes: #225336)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Dec 2003 16:47:57 -0800

apt (0.6.4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Use the top-level Release file in LoadReleaseInfo, rather than looking
    for the per-section ones (which aren't downloaded anymore).  This
    unbreaks release pinning, including the NotAutomatic bit used by
    project/experimental
  * Use FileFd::Size() rather than a separate stat() call in
    LoadReleaseInfo
  * Fix pkgTagFile to leave a little extra room at the end of the buffer
    to append the record separator if it isn't present
  * Change LoadReleaseInfo to use "Suite" rather than "Archive", to match
    the Debian archive's dist-level Release files

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Dec 2003 15:55:55 -0800

apt (0.6.3) experimental; urgency=low

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Dec 2003 12:11:56 -0800

apt (0.6.2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add space between package names when multiple unauthenticated packages
    are being installed (Closes: #225212)
  * Provide apt-key with a secret keyring and a trustdb, even though we
    would never use them, because it blows up if it doesn't have them
  * Fix typo in apt-key(8) (standard input is '-', not '/')

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat, 27 Dec 2003 13:01:40 -0800

apt (0.6.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Merge apt 0.5.17
  * Rearrange Release file authentication code to be more clear
  * If Release is present, but Release.gpg is not, don't forget to still
    queue Packages files
  * Convert distribution "../project/experimental" to "experimental" for
    comparison purposes
  * Make a number of Release file errors into warnings; for now, it is OK
    not to have a codename, for example.  We mostly care about checksums
    for now

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Fri, 26 Dec 2003 15:12:47 -0800

apt (0.6.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * Signature verification support patch ("apt-secure") from Colin Walters
    <walters@debian.org> and Isaac Jones <ijones@syntaxpolice.org>.  This
    implements:
     - Release signature verification (Release.gpg)
     - Packages, Sources md5sum verification against Release
     - Closes: #203741
  * Make some modifications to signature verification support:
    - Release.gpg is always retrieved and verified if present, rather than
      requiring that sources be configured as secure
    - Print a hint about installing gnupg if exec(gpgv) fails
    - Remove obsolete pkgAcqIndexRel
    - Move vendors.list stuff into a separate module (vendorlist.{h,cc})
    - If any files about to be retrieved are not authenticated, issue a
      warning to the user and require confirmation
    - Fix a heap corruption bug in pkgSrcRecords::pkgSrcRecords()
  * Suggests: gnupg
  * Install a keyring in /usr/share/apt/debian-archive.gpg containing an
    initial set of Debian archive signing keys to seed /etc/apt/trusted.gpg
  * Add a new tool, apt-key(8) used to manage the keyring

  * Add APT::Periodic::Autoclean setting, to allow "apt-get autoclean" to
    be run periodically.  This is useful with
    APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages, and defaults to the same
    value, so that the cache size is bounded

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Nov 2004 12:53:04 -0800

apt (0.5.30ubuntu2) hoary; urgency=low

    /var/lib/apt itself
  * Standardize debhelper files a bit
    - Create all directories in debian/dirs rather than creating some on
      the dh_installdirs command line

      version 1.3 from debian-doc cvs
    - Create doc/es/.cvsignore
  * Patch from Koblinger Egmont <egmont@uhulinux.hu> to fix
    pkgCache::PkgFileIterator::Label() to correctly refer to File->Label
    rather than File->Origin (Closes: #213311)
  * Add missing comma and space to German translation of "downgraded"
    (Closes: #213975)
  * Add missing comma in apt_preferences(5) (Closes: #215362)
  * Fix whitespace in French translation of "Yes, do as I say!", which
    made it tricky to type.  Thanks to Sylvain Pasche
    <sylvain.pasche@switzerland.org> (Closes: #217152)
  * Let apt-get build-dep try alternatives if the installed package
    doesn't meet version requirements (Closes: #214736)
  * Fix version display for recommends (Closes: #219900)
  * Use isatty rather than ttyname for checking if stdin is a terminal.
    isatty has the advantage of not requiring /proc under Linux, and thus
    Closes: #221728
  * Correctly implement -n as a synonym for --names-only (Closes: #224515)
  * Update apt-cache(8)
    - Document --installed
    - --recursive applies to both depends and rdepends
  * Japanese translation of documentation from Kurasawa Nozomu <nabetaro@slug.jp>
    (Closes: #186235)
  * Clarify documentation of --no-upgrade in apt-get(8) (Closes: #219743)
  * Clean up and simplify some of the suggests/recommends display in apt-get
  * Use cvs update -d in debian/rules cvs-build rather than just update
  * Pass --preserve-envvar PATH --preserve-envvar CCACHE_DIR to debuild.  apt
    takes a long time to build, and ccache helps

apt (0.5.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-get build-dep, when trying to skip over the remaining elements of
    an or-expression, would accidentally inherit the version requirements of a
    later item in the or-expression.  Fixed it.
  * Let apt-get build-dep try alternatives if the first dependency in an
    or-expression is not available
  * Add a Debug::BuildDeps to generate some trace output
  * Help apt-get build-dep produce more useful error messages
  * Process build-dependencies in forward rather than reverse order
  * Error out if an installed package is too new for a << or <=
    build-dependency
  * apt-get build-dep should now be able to handle almost any package with
    correct build-depends.  The primary exception is build-dependencies on
    virtual packages with more than one provider, and these are
    discouraged for automated processing (but still common,
    unfortunately).

apt (0.5.13) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Document configuration file comment syntax in apt.conf(5)
    (Closes: #211262)
  * s/removed/installed/ in a comment in apt-get.cc
  * Move comment for ListParser::ParseDepends into the right place
  * Don't preserve ownership when copying config.guess and config.sub.
    This broke builds where the clean target was run with different
    privileges than the rest of the build (i.e., root) (Closes: #212183)
  * On second thought, don't copy config.guess and config.sub at all.  I'd
    rather they always match what is in CVS.

apt (0.5.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated pt_BR translations from Andre Luis Lopes <andrelop@debian.org>

    rather than just "methods"

  * Clean up reportbug script a bit, and extend it to distinguish between a
    configuration file not existing and the user declining to submit it with
    the report
  * Add #include <langinfo.h> to cmdline/apt-get.cc.  This apparently gets
    pulled in by something else with recent g++ and/or glibc, but is
    required when building on, e.g., stable
  * Patch from Koblinger Egmont <egmont@uhulinux.hu> to fix version
    comparisons with '~' (Closes: #205960)
  * Disable Russian translation until someone can review it

  * Regenerate French man pages from sgml source (Closes: #205886)
  * Get self-tests compiling again, updated for latest library API
    and g++ 3.3
  * Add version comparison tests for #194327 and #205960
  * Fix error message in version test to output versions in the order in
    which they were compared when the reverse comparison fails
  * Reference the source package bug page rather than the one for the
    binary package 'apt' in the man pages (Closes: #205290)
  * Updated Polish po file from Marcin Owsiany <porridge@debian.org>
    (Closes: #205950)

  * Add apt-config to SEE ALSO section of apt-get (Closes: #205036)
  * Add missing "lang" attributes to refentry tags in French man pages
    (apt-cdrom, apt-extracttemplates, apt-sortpkgs)
  * Change upgraded/newly installed/not fully installed or removed
    messages to be consistent and somewhat shorter (some translations
    exceeded 80 characters even in the simplest case)
  * Make APT::Get::Show-Upgraded (aka apt-get -u) default to true.
  * Updates to Dutch translation from Bart Cornelis <cobaco@linux.be>

apt (0.5.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Oh well, apt isn't going to make it into testing anytime soon due to
    new glibc and gcc deps, so we might as well fix more bugs
  * Fix typo in example ftp-archive.conf (Closes: #203295)
  * Mention default setting for --all-versions (Closes: #203298)
  * Patch from Otavio Salvador <otavio@debian.org> to have --version
    only print the version (and not usage as well) (Closes: #203418)
  * Patch from Otavio Salvador <otavio@debian.org> to switch from
    dh_installmanpages to dh_installman.  Fixes the problem where the
    pt_BR man page was installed in the wrong location (Closes: #194558)
  * Move the French apt-ftparchive man page into apt-utils where it
    belongs.  apt-utils Replaces: apt (<< 0.5.9)
  * Write records from "apt-cache show" using fwrite(3) rather than
    write(2), in case for some reason the entire record doesn't get
    written by a single write(2)
  * Add new French man pages to doc/fr/.cvsignore
  * Add freebsd to buildlib/ostable (Closes: #193430)
  * Avoid segfault if a package name is specified which consists
    entirely of characters which look like end tags ('+', '-')
    (Closes: #200425)
  * Patch from Otavio Salvador <otavio@debian.org> to avoid listing
    suggests/recommends for packages which are selected for installation
    at the same time as the package which suggests/recommends them
    (Closes: #200102)
  * Patch from Otavio Salvador <otavio@debian.org> to avoid listing
    suggests/recommends which are Provided by a package which is already
    installed (Closes: #200395)
  * Patch to update pt_BR man page for apt_preferences(5) from Andre Luis
    Lopes <andrelop@debian.org> (Closes: #202245)
  * Use nl_langinfo(YESEXPR) rather than comparing to the translated
    string "Y".  Closes: #200953 and should make the prompting generally
    more robust in the face of i18n.  In the particular case of #200953,
    it was being fooled because of signedness issues with toupper(3)
    (Closes: #194614)
  * apt Suggests: aptitude | synaptic | gnome-apt | wajig
    (Closes: #146667)
  * Clean up whitespace in translated strings in ru.po, which messed up
    indentation (some other translations probably have similar problems)
    (Closes: #194282)
  * Run ispell -h over the man page sources and fix a bunch of typos
  * Use debian/compat rather than DH_COMPAT
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level 3
    - remove ldconfig calls from debian/{postinst,postrm} as dh_makeshlibs
      will add them
    - echo 3 > debian/compat
    - Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 3)
  * Exclude '.#*' from cvs-build
  * Let the ftp method work with ftp servers which do not require a
    password (Closes: #199425)
  * Build-depend on debhelper >= 4.1.62, because we need the fix for
    #204731 in order for dh_installman to work correctly
    with our SGML man pages
  * Move dh_makeshlibs ahead of dh_installdeb so that its postinst
    fragments are properly substituted

apt (0.5.8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * urgency=medium because the changes since 0.5.5.1 are pretty safe as
    far as core functionality, 0.5.5.1 survived unstable for 10 days, and
    I don't want to delay apt's progress into testing any further.  It's
    decidedly better than 0.5.4.
  * Clarify the meaning of the only-source option in apt-get(8)
    (Closes: #177258)
  * Updated French man pages from Philippe Batailler

  * Give a warning if an illegal type abbreviation is used when looking up a
    configuration item (Closes: #168453)
  * Improve build-depends handling of virtual packages even further, so that
    it will now also try to satisfy build-depends on virtual packages if they
    are not installed.  Note that this only works if there is only one
    package providing the virtual package, as in other cases (Closes: #165404)
  * Update config.guess and config.sub from autotools-dev 20030717.1
  * Tweak SGML in apt-extracttemplates.1.sgml so that literal '>' doesn't end
    up in output
  * Document SrcDirectory in apt-ftparchive.1.sgml (Closes: #156370)
  * Support TMPDIR in apt-extracttemplates (Closes: #191656)
  * Fix ru.po to use a capital letter for the translation of 'Y' so that
    YnPrompt works correctly (Closes: #200953).  No other translations seem
    to have this problem
  * Regenerate POT file and sync .po files
  * Only try to clear stdin if it is a tty, to avoid looping if there is
    lots of stuff (perhaps an infinite amount) to read (Closes: #192228)
