 <refsect1><title>Description</title>
   <para><command>apt-get</command> is the command-line tool for handling packages, and may be 
   considered the user's "back-end" to other tools using the APT
   library.  Several "front-end" interfaces exist, such as &dselect;,
   &aptitude;, &synaptic;, &gnome-apt; and &wajig;.</para>

   <para>Unless the <option>-h</option>, or <option>--help</option> option is given, one of the
   commands below must be present.</para>
   
   <variablelist>
     <varlistentry><term>update</term>
     <listitem><para><literal>update</literal> is used to resynchronize the package index files from
     their sources. The indexes of available packages are fetched from the
     location(s) specified in <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename>.
     For example, when using a Debian archive, this command retrieves and
     scans the <filename>Packages.gz</filename> files, so that information about new 
     and updated packages is available. An <literal>update</literal> should always be 
     performed before an <literal>upgrade</literal> or <literal>dist-upgrade</literal>. Please 
     be aware that the overall progress meter will be incorrect as the size 
     of the package files cannot be known in advance.</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     
     <varlistentry><term>upgrade</term>
     <listitem><para><literal>upgrade</literal> is used to install the newest versions of all packages 
     currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in
     <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename>. Packages currently installed with 
     new versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no circumstances 
     are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed 
     retrieved and installed. New versions of currently installed packages that 
     cannot be upgraded without changing the install status of another package 
     will be left at their current version. An <literal>update</literal> must be 
     performed first so that <command>apt-get</command> knows that new versions of packages are 
     available.</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>dselect-upgrade</term>
     <listitem><para><literal>dselect-upgrade</literal>
     is used in conjunction with the traditional Debian packaging
     front-end, &dselect;. <literal>dselect-upgrade</literal>
     follows the changes made by &dselect; to the <literal>Status</literal>
     field of available packages, and performs the actions necessary to realize
     that state (for instance, the removal of old and the installation of new
     packages).</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>dist-upgrade</term>
     <listitem><para><literal>dist-upgrade</literal> in addition to performing the function of 
     <literal>upgrade</literal>, also intelligently handles changing dependencies 
     with new versions of packages; <command>apt-get</command> has a "smart" conflict 
     resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important 
     packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary. 
	 So, <literal>dist-upgrade</literal> command may remove some packages.
     The <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename> file contains a list of locations 
     from which to retrieve desired package files.
     See also &apt-preferences; for a mechanism for
     overriding the general settings for individual packages.</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>install</term>
     <listitem>
	 <para><literal>install</literal> is followed by one or more 
	 packages desired for installation or upgrading. 
	 Each package is a package name, not a fully qualified 
	 filename (for instance, in a Debian GNU/Linux system, 
	 libc6 would be the argument provided, not 
	 <literal>libc6_1.9.6-2.deb</literal>). All packages required 
	 by the package(s) specified for installation will also 
	 be retrieved and installed. 
	 The <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename> file is 
	 used to locate the desired packages. If a hyphen is 
	 appended to the package name (with no intervening space), 
	 the identified package will be removed if it is installed. 
	 Similarly a plus sign can be used to designate a 
	 package to install. These latter features may be used 
	 to override decisions made by apt-get's conflict 
	 resolution system.
	 </para>

     <para>A specific version of a package can be selected for installation by 
     following the package name with an equals and the version of the package 
     to select. This will cause that version to be located and selected for
     install. Alternatively a specific distribution can be selected by 
     following the package name with a slash and the version of the 
     distribution or the Archive name (stable, testing, unstable).</para>

     <para>Both of the version selection mechanisms can downgrade packages and must
     be used with care.</para>

	<para>This is also the target to use if you want to upgrade one or 
		more already-installed packages without upgrading every package 
		you have on your system. Unlike the "upgrade" target, which 
		installs the newest version of all currently installed packages, 
		"install" will install the newest version of only the package(s) 
		specified. Simply provide the name of the package(s) you wish 
		to upgrade, and if a newer version is available, it (and its 
		dependencies, as described above) will be downloaded and 
		installed.
	</para>

     <para>Finally, the &apt-preferences; mechanism allows you to
     create an alternative installation policy for
     individual packages.</para>

     <para>If no package matches the given expression and the expression contains one
     of '.', '?' or '*' then it is assumed to be a POSIX regular expression,
     and it is applied
     to all package names in the database. Any matches are then installed (or
     removed). Note that matching is done by substring so 'lo.*' matches 'how-lo'
     and 'lowest'. If this is undesired, anchor the regular expression
     with a '^' or '$' character, or create a more specific regular expression.</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>remove</term>
     <listitem><para><literal>remove</literal> is identical to <literal>install</literal> except that packages are 
	 removed instead of installed. Note the removing a package leaves its
	 configuration files in system. If a plus sign is appended to the package 
     name (with no intervening space), the identified package will be 
     installed instead of removed.</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>purge</term>
     <listitem><para><literal>purge</literal> is identical to <literal>remove</literal> except that packages are 
     removed and purged (any configuration files are deleted too).</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>source</term>
     <listitem><para><literal>source</literal> causes <command>apt-get</command> to fetch source packages. APT 
     will examine the available packages to decide which source package to 
     fetch. It will then find and download into the current directory the 
     newest available version of that source package. Source packages are 
     tracked separately from binary packages via <literal>deb-src</literal> type lines 
     in the &sources-list; file. This probably will mean that you will not 
     get the same source as the package you have installed or as you could 
     install. If the --compile options is specified then the package will be 
     compiled to a binary .deb using dpkg-buildpackage, if --download-only is 
     specified then the source package will not be unpacked.</para>

     <para>A specific source version can be retrieved by postfixing the source name
     with an equals and then the version to fetch, similar to the mechanism
     used for the package files. This enables exact matching of the source 
     package name and version, implicitly enabling the 
     <literal>APT::Get::Only-Source</literal> option.</para>
     
     <para>Note that source packages are not tracked like binary packages, they 
     exist only in the current directory and are similar to downloading source
     tar balls.</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>build-dep</term>
     <listitem><para><literal>build-dep</literal> causes apt-get to install/remove packages in an 
     attempt to satisfy the build dependencies for a source package.</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>check</term>
     <listitem><para><literal>check</literal> is a diagnostic tool; it updates the package cache and checks 
     for broken dependencies.</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>clean</term>
     <listitem><para><literal>clean</literal> clears out the local repository of retrieved package 
     files. It removes everything but the lock file from 
     <filename>&cachedir;/archives/</filename> and 
     <filename>&cachedir;/archives/partial/</filename>. When APT is used as a 
     &dselect; method, <literal>clean</literal> is run automatically.
     Those who do not use dselect will likely want to run <literal>apt-get clean</literal>
     from time to time to free up disk space.</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>autoclean</term>
     <listitem><para>Like <literal>clean</literal>, <literal>autoclean</literal> clears out the local 
     repository of retrieved package files. The difference is that it only 
     removes package files that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely 
     useless. This allows a cache to be maintained over a long period without 
     it growing out of control. The configuration option 
     <literal>APT::Clean-Installed</literal> will prevent installed packages from being
     erased if it is set to off.</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term>autoremove</term>
     <listitem><para><literal>autoremove</literal> is used to remove packages that were automatically
     installed to satisfy dependencies for some package and that are no more needed.</para></listitem>

     must completely correct the problem. The option is sometimes necessary when 
     running APT for the first time; APT itself does not allow broken package 
     dependencies to exist on a system. It is possible that a system's 
     dependency structure can be so corrupt as to require manual intervention 
     (which usually means using &dselect; or <command>dpkg --remove</command> to eliminate some of 
     the offending packages). Use of this option together with <option>-m</option> may produce an
