 <refsect1><title>Description</title>
   <para><command>apt-get</command> is the command-line tool for handling packages, and may be 
   considered the user's "back-end" to other tools using the APT
   library.  Several "front-end" interfaces exist, such as
   &aptitude;, &synaptic; and &wajig;.</para>

   <para>Unless the <option>-h</option>, or <option>--help</option> option is given, one of the
   commands below must be present.</para>
   
   <variablelist>
     <varlistentry><term><option>update</option></term>
     <listitem><para><literal>update</literal> is used to resynchronize the package index files from
     their sources. The indexes of available packages are fetched from the
     location(s) specified in <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename>.
     For example, when using a Debian archive, this command retrieves and
     scans the <filename>Packages.gz</filename> files, so that information about new 
     and updated packages is available. An <literal>update</literal> should always be 
     performed before an <literal>upgrade</literal> or <literal>dist-upgrade</literal>. Please 
     be aware that the overall progress meter will be incorrect as the size 
     of the package files cannot be known in advance.</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     
     <varlistentry><term><option>upgrade</option></term>
     <listitem><para><literal>upgrade</literal> is used to install the newest versions of all packages 
     currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in
     <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename>. Packages currently installed with 
     new versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no circumstances 
     are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed 
     retrieved and installed. New versions of currently installed packages that 
     cannot be upgraded without changing the install status of another package 
     will be left at their current version. An <literal>update</literal> must be 
     performed first so that <command>apt-get</command> knows that new versions of packages are 
     available.</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term><option>dist-upgrade</option></term>
     <listitem><para><literal>dist-upgrade</literal> in addition to performing the function of 
     <literal>upgrade</literal>, also intelligently handles changing dependencies 
     with new versions of packages; <command>apt-get</command> has a "smart" conflict 
     resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important 
     packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary. 
     The <literal>dist-upgrade</literal> command may therefore remove some packages.
     The <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename> file contains a list of locations 
     from which to retrieve desired package files.
     See also &apt-preferences; for a mechanism for
     overriding the general settings for individual packages.</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term><option>dselect-upgrade</option></term>
     <listitem><para><literal>dselect-upgrade</literal>
     is used in conjunction with the traditional Debian packaging
     front-end, &dselect;. <literal>dselect-upgrade</literal>
     follows the changes made by &dselect; to the <literal>Status</literal>
     field of available packages, and performs the actions necessary to realize
     that state (for instance, the removal of old and the installation of new
     packages).</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term><option>install</option></term>
     <listitem>
	 <para><literal>install</literal> is followed by one or more 
	 packages desired for installation or upgrading. 
	 Each package is a package name, not a fully qualified 
	 filename (for instance, in a Debian system, 
	 <package>apt-utils</package> would be the argument provided, not 
	 <filename>apt-utils_&apt-product-version;_amd64.deb</filename>). All packages required 
	 by the package(s) specified for installation will also 
	 be retrieved and installed. 
	 The <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename> file is 
	 used to locate the desired packages. If a hyphen is 
	 appended to the package name (with no intervening space), 
	 the identified package will be removed if it is installed. 
	 Similarly a plus sign can be used to designate a 
	 package to install. These latter features may be used 
	 to override decisions made by apt-get's conflict 
	 resolution system.
	 </para>

     <para>A specific version of a package can be selected for installation by 
     following the package name with an equals and the version of the package 
     to select. This will cause that version to be located and selected for
     install. Alternatively a specific distribution can be selected by 
     following the package name with a slash and the version of the 
     distribution or the Archive name (stable, testing, unstable).</para>

     <para>Both of the version selection mechanisms can downgrade packages and must
     be used with care.</para>

	<para>This is also the target to use if you want to upgrade one or 
		more already-installed packages without upgrading every package 
		you have on your system. Unlike the "upgrade" target, which 
		installs the newest version of all currently installed packages, 
		"install" will install the newest version of only the package(s) 
		specified. Simply provide the name of the package(s) you wish 
		to upgrade, and if a newer version is available, it (and its 
		dependencies, as described above) will be downloaded and 
		installed.
	</para>

     <para>Finally, the &apt-preferences; mechanism allows you to
     create an alternative installation policy for
     individual packages.</para>

     <para>If no package matches the given expression and the expression contains one
     of '.', '?' or '*' then it is assumed to be a POSIX regular expression,
     and it is applied
     to all package names in the database. Any matches are then installed (or
     removed). Note that matching is done by substring so 'lo.*' matches 'how-lo'
     and 'lowest'. If this is undesired, anchor the regular expression
     with a '^' or '$' character, or create a more specific regular expression.</para>
     <para>Fallback to regular expressions is deprecated in APT 2.0, has been removed in
     &apt;, except for anchored expressions, and will be removed from &apt-get;
     in a future version. Use &apt-patterns; instead.</para></listitem>

     <varlistentry><term><option>reinstall</option></term>

     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term><option>remove</option></term>
     <listitem><para><literal>remove</literal> is identical to <literal>install</literal> except that packages are 
	 removed instead of installed. Note that removing a package leaves its
	 configuration files on the system. If a plus sign is appended to the package 
     name (with no intervening space), the identified package will be 
     installed instead of removed.</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term><option>purge</option></term>
     <listitem><para><literal>purge</literal> is identical to <literal>remove</literal> except that packages are 
     removed and purged (any configuration files are deleted too).</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term><option>source</option></term>
     <listitem><para><literal>source</literal> causes <command>apt-get</command> to fetch source packages. APT 
     will examine the available packages to decide which source package to 
     fetch. It will then find and download into the current directory the 
     newest available version of that source package while respecting the
     default release, set with the option <literal>APT::Default-Release</literal>,
     the <option>-t</option> option or per package with the
     <literal>pkg/release</literal> syntax, if possible.</para>

    <para>The arguments are interpreted as binary and source package names.
    See the <option>--only-source</option> option if you want to change that.</para>

     <para>Source packages are tracked separately
     from binary packages via <literal>deb-src</literal> lines 
     in the &sources-list; file. This means that you will need to add such a line
     for each repository you want to get sources from; otherwise you will probably
     get either the wrong (too old/too new) source versions or none at all.</para>

     <para>If the <option>--compile</option> option is specified
     then the package will be compiled to a binary .deb using
     <command>dpkg-buildpackage</command> for the architecture as
     defined by the <command>--host-architecture</command> option.
     If <option>--download-only</option> is specified then the source package
     will not be unpacked.</para>

     <para>A specific source version can be retrieved by postfixing the source name
     with an equals and then the version to fetch, similar to the mechanism
     used for the package files. This enables exact matching of the source 
     package name and version, implicitly enabling the 
     <literal>APT::Get::Only-Source</literal> option.</para>

     <para>Note that source packages are not installed and tracked in the
     <command>dpkg</command> database like binary packages; they are simply downloaded
     to the current directory, like source tarballs.</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term><option>build-dep</option></term>
     <listitem><para><literal>build-dep</literal> causes apt-get to install/remove packages in an 
     attempt to satisfy the build dependencies for a source package. By default the dependencies are
     satisfied to build the package natively. If desired a host-architecture can be specified
     with the <option>--host-architecture</option> option instead.</para><para>The arguments are
     interpreted as binary or source package names. See the <option>--only-source</option>
     option if you want to change that.</para></listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term><option>satisfy</option></term>
     <listitem><para><literal>satisfy</literal> causes apt-get to satisfy the given dependency strings. The
     dependency strings may have build profiles and architecture restriction list as in build dependencies. They
     may optionally be prefixed with <literal>"Conflicts: "</literal> to unsatisfy the dependency string. Multiple strings of the same type can be specified.</para>

     <para>Example: <literal>apt-get satisfy "foo" "Conflicts: bar" "baz (&gt;&gt; 1.0) | bar (= 2.0), moo"</literal></para>

     <para>The legacy operator '&lt;/&gt;' is not supported, use '&lt;=/&gt;=' instead.</para>

     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry><term><option>autoclean</option> (and the <option>auto-clean</option> alias since 1.1)</term>
     <listitem><para>Like <literal>clean</literal>, <literal>autoclean</literal> clears out the local 
     repository of retrieved package files. The difference is that it only 
     removes package files that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely 
     useless. This allows a cache to be maintained over a long period without 
     it growing out of control. The configuration option 
     <literal>APT::Clean-Installed</literal> will prevent installed packages from being
     erased if it is set to off.</para></listitem>

     <varlistentry><term><option>autoremove</option> (and the <option>auto-remove</option> alias since 1.1)</term>
     <listitem><para><literal>autoremove</literal> is used to remove packages that were automatically

	<listitem><para><literal>changelog</literal> tries to download the
